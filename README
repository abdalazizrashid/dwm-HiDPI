gridwm
------

gridwm is an extremly fast, small, and automatic X11 window manager.  It
arranges all windows in a grid.


Requirements
------------
In order to build gridwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup. gridwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install gridwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running gridwm
--------------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start gridwm using startx:

    exec gridwm

In order to connect gridwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec gridwm

This will start gridwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of gridwm is done by customizing the wm.h source file. To
customize the key bindings edit kb.c.
