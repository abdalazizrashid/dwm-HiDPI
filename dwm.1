.SH SYNOPSIS

.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dwm
is a dynamic window manager for X11. It consists of a small status bar and
arranges windows in either a tiled or floating mode.
.P
In tiled mode
.B dwm
manages all windows in a left master column and a right stacking column. The
master column contains a single window, the left stacking column all other
windows. Dialog windows are treated floating.
.P
In floating mode
.B dwm
manages all windows in a conventional way. They can be resized and moved freely
with the mouse.
.P
Windows are grouped by tags. You can view all windows with a specific tag per
time.  However, each window is allowed to contain more than one tag, which
allows to make windows visible in all views.
.P
.B dwm
reads from standard input to display status text, if written.
.P
.B dwm
draws 1-pixel borders around windows to indicate the focus state and providing as
much screen real estate as possible. Unfocused windows contain a small bar
in front of the window indicating the tags and the window title.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
prints version information to standard output, then exits.
.SH CUSTOMIZATION
.B dwm
is customized through editing its source code. It is assumed that
.B dwm
users know to patch it for their needs. This keeps it fast, secure and simple,
because it does not process any input data, except window properties and
the status text read from standard input.
