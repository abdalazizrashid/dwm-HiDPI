dwm \- dynamic window manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dwm
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dwm
is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiling and floating
modes. Either mode can be applied dynamically, optimizing the environment for
the application in use and the task performed.
.P
In tiling mode windows are managed in a master and stacking column. The master
column contains the window which currently needs most attention, whereas the
stacking column contains all other windows. In floating mode windows can be
resized and moved freely. Dialog windows are always managed floating,
regardless of the mode selected.
.P
Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or multiple
tags. Selecting a certain tag for viewing will display all windows with that
tag.
.P
.B dwm
contains a small status bar which displays all available tags, the mode, the
title of the focused window, and the text read from standard input. The tags of
the focused window are highlighted with a small point.
.P
.B dwm
draws a 1-pixel border around windows to indicate the focus state.
Unfocused windows contain a small bar in front of them displaying their title.
