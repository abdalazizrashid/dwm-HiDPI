.SH NAME
dwm \- dynamic window manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dwm
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dwm
is a dynamic window manager for X11. It manages windows in tiling and floating
modes. Either mode can be applied dynamically, depending on the application in
use and the task performed.
.P
In tiling mode windows are managed in a master and stacking column. The master
column contains the window which needs most attention at a time, whereas the
stacking column contains all other windows in a stack.  Dialog windows are
managed floating, however. In floating mode windows can be resized and moved
freely.
.P
Windows are grouped by tags. All windows with a specific tag can be viewed at a
time. But each window may contain more than one tag, which makes it visible in
several views.
.P
.B dwm
has a small status bar which reads the text displayed from standard
input, if written. It draws 1-pixel borders around windows to indicate the
focus state. Unfocused windows contain a small bar in front of the window
displaying the tags and the window title.
