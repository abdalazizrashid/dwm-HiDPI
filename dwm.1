.SH NAME
dwm \- dynamic window manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dwm
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiling and
floating modes. Either mode can be applied dynamically, optimizing the
environment for the application in use and the task performed.
.P
In tiling mode windows are managed in a master and stacking area. The master
area contains the window which currently needs most attention, whereas the
stacking area contains all other windows. In floating mode windows can be
resized and moved freely. Dialog windows are always managed floating,
regardless of the mode selected.
.P
Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or multiple
tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these tags.
.P
dwm contains a small status bar which displays all available tags, the mode,
the title of the focused window, and the text read from standard input. The
selected tags are highlighted with a different color, the tags of the focused
window are highlighted with a small point.
.P
dwm draws a 1-pixel border around windows to indicate the focus state.
Unfocused windows contain a small bar in front of them displaying their title.
