.SH NAME
dwm \- dynamic window manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dwm
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiling and
floating modes. Either mode can be applied dynamically, optimizing the
environment for the application in use and the task performed.
.P
In tiling mode windows are managed in a master and stacking area. The master
area contains the windows which currently need most attention, whereas the
stacking area contains all other windows. In floating mode windows can be
resized and moved freely. Dialog windows are always managed floating,
regardless of the mode applied.
.P
Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or multiple
tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these tags.
.P
dwm contains a small status bar which displays all available tags, the mode,
the title of the focused window, and the text read from standard input. The
selected tags are indicated with a different color. The tags of the focused
window are indicated with a filled square in the top left corner.  The tags
which are applied to one or more windows are indicated with an empty square in
the top left corner.
.P
dwm draws a small border around windows to indicate the focus state.

.SH CUSTOMIZATION
dwm is customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the source
code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR dmenu (1)
.SH BUGS
The status bar may display
.BR "EOF"
when dwm has been started by an X session manager like
.BR xdm (1),
because those close standard output before executing dwm.
.P
Java applications which use the XToolkit/XAWT backend may draw grey windows
only. The XToolkit/XAWT backend breaks ICCCM-compliance in recent JDK 1.5 and early
JDK 1.6 versions, because it assumes a reparenting window manager. As a workaround
you can use JDK 1.4 (which doesn't contain the XToolkit/XAWT backend) or you
can set the following environment variable (to use the older Motif
backend instead):
.BR AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit .
