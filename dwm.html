		<h2>Description</h3>
		<p>
		dwm is a dynamic window manager for X11.
		</p>
		<h2>Differences to wmii</h2	
		<p>
		In contrast to wmii, dwm is only a window manager, and nothing else.
		Hence, it is much smaller, faster and simpler. dwm does
		<b>not</b> include following features wmii provides:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>9P support</li>
			<li>status bar</li>
			<li>menu</li>
			<li>editable tagbars</li>
			<li>shell-based config/control file</li>
			<li>small tools (selection printer, mouse warper)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		dwm is only a single binary, it's source code is intended to never
		exceed 2000 SLOC.
		</p>
		<p>
		dwm is customized through editing its source code, that makes it
		extremely fast and secure - it does not process any input data which
		hasn't been known at compile time, except window title names.
		</p>
		<p>
		dwm is based on tagging and dynamic window management (however simpler
		than wmii or larswm).
		</p>
		<p>
		dwm don't distinguishes between layers, there is no floating or managed
		layer. Wether the clients of currently selected tag are managed or not
		managed, you can re-arrange all clients on the fly. Popup- and
		fixed-size windows are treated unmanaged. 
		</p>
		<p>
		dwm uses 1-pixel borders to provide the maximum of screen real
		estate to clients. Small titlebars are only drawn in front of unfocused
		clients.
		</p>
		<p>
		garbeam <b>don't</b> wants any feedback to dwm. If you ask for support,
		feature requests or if you report bugs, they will be <b>ignored</b>
		with a high chance. dwm is only intended to fit garbeam's needs,
		however you are free to download and distribute/relicense it, with the
		conditions of the <a href="http://wmii.de/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/dwm?f=f10eb1139362;file=LICENSE;style=raw">MIT/X Consortium license</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>Development</h2>
		<p>
		dwm is actively developed in parallel to wmii. You can <a href="http://wmii.de/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/dwm">browse</a> its source code repository or get a copy using <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/">Mercurial</a> with following command:
		</p>
		<p>
		<em>hg clone http://wmii.de/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/dwm</em>
